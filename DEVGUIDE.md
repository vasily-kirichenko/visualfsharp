# Development Guide

## Get the Latest F# Compiler Source Code

Get the latest source code from the master branch by running this git command:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp.git
    
Before running the build scripts, ensure that you have cleaned up the visualfsharp repo by running this git command:

    git clean -xfd

This will remove any files that are not under version control. This is necessary only if you have already attempted to build the solution or have made other changes that might prevent it from building.

## Installing Dependencies and Building

Follow the instructions below to build and develop the F# Compiler, Core Library and tools on Windows, macOS and Linux.

### Developing the F# Compiler (Windows)

Install

- [.NET 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48130)

**NOTE on Windows:**

1. It is recommended to run `build.cmd` in a command prompt with path set to have the location of MSBuild. If you have Visual Studio, we can run using `Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio 20xx` (depends on Visual Studio version). This developer command prompt is easier to use than normal command prompt, because it already has the correct path of Visual Studio and .NET's tooling set for us to use (including MSBuild).

2. The command prompt must have Administrator rights (`Run as Administrator`).

On Windows you can build the F# compiler for .NET Framework as follows:

    build.cmd

This is the same as

    build.cmd net40

There are various qualifiers:

    build.cmd release         -- build release (the default)
    build.cmd debug           -- build debug instead of release

    build.cmd net40           -- build .NET Framework compiler (the default)
    build.cmd coreclr         -- build .NET Core compiler 
    build.cmd vs              -- build the Visual F# IDE Tools (see below)
    build.cmd pcls            -- build the PCL FSharp.Core libraries
    build.cmd all             -- build all 

    build.cmd proto           -- force the rebuild of the Proto bootstrap compiler in addition to other things

    build.cmd test            -- build default targets, run suitable tests
    build.cmd net40 test      -- build net40, run suitable tests
    build.cmd coreclr test    -- build coreclr, run suitable tests
    build.cmd vs test         -- build Visual F# IDE Tools, run all tests (see below)
    build.cmd all test        -- build all, run all tests

    build.cmd test-smoke      -- build, run smoke tests
    build.cmd test-net40-fsharp     -- build, run tests\fsharp suite for .NET Framework
    build.cmd test-net40-fsharpqa   -- build, run tests\fsharpqa suite for .NET Framework

After you build the first time you can open and use this solution:

    .\FSharp.sln

or just build it directly:

    msbuild FSharp.sln

If you are just developing the core compiler and library then building ``FSharp.sln`` will be enough.

### Developing the F# Compiler (Linux)

For Linux/Mono, follow [these instructions](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/). Also you may need:

    sudo apt-get install mono-complete make git

Then:

    make

Then to replace your machine-wide installation:

    sudo make install

Full testing is not yet enabled on Linux.

### Developing the F# Compiler (macOS)

Install XCode command line tools (or homebrew equivalents) and Mono or Visual Studio for Mac.

Then:

    make

Then to replace your machine-wide installation:

    sudo make install

Full testing is not yet enabled on macOS.

### [Optional] Specifying the install path (Linux or macOS)

You can specify a custom installation path using the DESTDIR shell variable

    DESTDIR=/my/path/to/fsharp make install

### Developing the F# Compiler (Linux or macOS - .NET Core)

Install [the latest .NET SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/).  Then use

    src/buildfromsource.sh

Outputs are placed in

    BuildFromSource/Debug/...
    BuildFromSource/Release/...

This uses an installed .NET SDK 2.0 to build the various duplicated project

Testing the .NET Core version of the F# compiler on macOS and Linux is TBD.

### Developing the Visual F# IDE Tools (Windows Only)

To build and test Visual F# IDE Tools, install these requirements:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
  - Under the "Windows" workloads, select ".NET desktop development"
    - Select "F# desktop language support" under the optional components
  - Under the "Other Toolsets" workloads, select "Visual Studio extension development"

Steps to build:

    build.cmd vs              -- build the Visual F# IDE Tools in Release configuration (see below)
    build.cmd vs debug        -- build the Visual F# IDE Tools in Debug configuration (see below)
    build.cmd vs test         -- build Visual F# IDE Tools, run all tests (see below)

Use ``VisualFSharp.sln`` if you're building the Visual F# IDE Tools.

Note on Debug vs Release: ``Release`` Configuration has a degraded debugging experience, so if you want to test a change locally, it is recommended to do it in the ``Debug`` configuration. For more information see issues [#2771](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/2771) and [#2773](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/2773).

Note ([#2351](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/2351)): if you face this error:

> error VSSDK1077: Unable to locate the extensions directory. "ExternalSettingsManager::GetScopePaths failed to initialize PkgDefManager for C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe".

Or hard crash on launch ("Unknown Error"), delete these folders:

- `%localappdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\15.0_(some number here)RoslynDev`
- `%localappdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\15.0_(some number here)`

#### [Optional] Install the Visual F# IDE Tools  (Windows Only)

The new builds of the Visual F# IDE Tools can no longer be installed into Visual Studio 2015.

You can install Visual Studio 2017 from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/.

**Note:** This step will install a VSIX extension into Visual Studio "Next" that changes the Visual F# IDE Tools 
components installed in that VS installation.  You can revert this step by disabling or uninstalling the addin.

For **Debug**, uninstall then reinstall:

    VSIXInstaller.exe /u:"VisualFSharp"
    VSIXInstaller.exe debug\net40\bin\VisualFSharpFull.vsix

For **Release**, uninstall then reinstall:

    VSIXInstaller.exe /u:"VisualFSharp"
    VSIXInstaller.exe release\net40\bin\VisualFSharpFull.vsix

Restart Visual Studio, it should now be running your freshly-built Visual F# IDE Tools with updated F# Interactive.

#### [Optional] F5 testing of local changes

To test your changes locally _without_ overwriting your default installed Visual F# tools, set the `VisualFSharp\Vsix\VisualFSharpFull`
project as the startup project.  When you hit F5 a new instance of Visual Studio will be started in the `RoslynDev` hive with your
changes, but the root (default) hive will remain untouched. You can also start this hive automatically using

    devenv.exe /rootsuffix RoslynDev

Because this uses the "RoslynDev" hive you can simultaneously test changes to an appropriate build of Roslyn binaries.

#### [Optional] Rapid deployment of incremental changes to Visual F# IDE Tools components

For the brave, you can rapidly deploy incrementally updated versions of Visual F# IDE Tool components such as ``FSHarp.Editor.dll`` by copying them directly into the extension directory in your user AppData folder:

    xcopy /y debug\net40\bin\FSharp.* "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\15.0_7c5620b7FSharpDev\Extensions\Microsoft.VisualFSharpTools\Visual F# Tools\15.4.1.9055"

This gives a much tighter inner development loop than uninstalling/reinstalling the VSIX, as you do not have to restart VIsual Studio. Caveat emptor.

#### [Optional] Clobber the F# SDK on the machine

**Note:** The step below will try to clobber the machine-wide installed F# SDK on your machine. This replaces the ``fsc.exe`` used by the standard install location or ``Microsoft.FSharp.Targets``.  **Repairing Visual Studio 15 is currently the only way to revert this step.**

For **Debug**:

    vsintegration\update-vsintegration.cmd debug

For **Release**:

    vsintegration\update-vsintegration.cmd release

## Notes

#### Windows: Links to  Additional frameworks

- [Git for windows](http://msysgit.github.io/)
- [.NET 4.6](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48137)
- [Windows 8.1 SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bg162891.aspx)
- [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)

#### Notes on the Windows .NET Framework build

1. The `update.cmd` script adds required strong name validation skips and NGens the compiler and libraries. This requires admin privileges.
1. The compiler binaries produced are "private" and strong-named signed with a test key.
1. Some additional tools are required to build the compiler, notably `fslex.exe`, `fsyacc.exe`, `FSharp.PowerPack.Build.Tasks.dll`, `FsSrGen.exe`, `FSharp.SRGen.Build.Tasks.dll`, and the other tools found in the `lkg` directory.
1. The overall bootstrapping process executes as follows
 - We first need an existing F# compiler. We use the one in the `lkg` directory. Let's assume this compiler has an `FSharp.Core.dll` with version X.
 - We use this compiler to compile the source in this distribution, to produce a "proto" compiler, dropped to the `proto` directory. When run, this compiler still relies on `FSharp.Core.dll` with version X.
 - We use the proto compiler to compile the source for `FSharp.Core.dll` in this distribution.
 - We use the proto compiler to compile the source for `FSharp.Compiler.dll`, `fsc.exe`, `fsi.exe`, and other binaries found in this distribution.

#### Updating FSComp.fs, FSComp.resx and XLF

If you change error messages you may need to update FSComp.fs in `src\buildfromsource\FSharp.Compiler.Private`.

To do this, build the non-buildfromsource version of FSharp.Compiler.Private (src\fsharp\FSharp.Compiler.Private) then check its obj\ directory for `FSComp.fs` and manually copy that into the buildfromsource directory.

    .\build net40
    copy /y src\fsharp\FSharp.Compiler.Private\obj\release\net40\FSComp.* src\buildfromsource\FSharp.Compiler.Private\

You can also change build.cmd to default COPY_FSCOMP_RESOURCE_FOR_BUILD_FROM_SOURCES to 1 under ":ARGUMENTS_OK" label.
 
If your changes involve modifying the list of language keywords in any way, (e.g. when implementing a new keyword), the XLF localization files need to be synced with the corresponding resx files. This can be done automatically by running

    pushd src\fsharp\FSharp.Compiler.Private
	msbuild FSharp.Compiler.Private.fsproj /t:UpdateXlf
	popd

This only works on Windows/.NETStandard framework, so changing this from any other platform requires editing and syncing all of the XLF files manually.


#### Configuring proxy server

If you are behind a proxy server, NuGet client tool must be configured to use it:

    .nuget\nuget.exe config -set http_proxy=proxy.domain.com:8080 -ConfigFile NuGet.Config
    .nuget\nuget.exe config -set http_proxy.user=user_name -ConfigFile NuGet.Config
    .nuget\nuget.exe config -set http_proxy.password=user_password -ConfigFile NuGet.Config

Where you should set proper proxy address, user name and password.
